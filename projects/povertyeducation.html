        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This project examined the relationship between poverty and education across various U.S. regions by integrating multiple socioeconomic datasets. Using Infor Birst, a business intelligence and analytics platform, we transformed raw data into an interactive dashboard that enabled users to explore how poverty and district/state spending impacts test scores and related indicators over time.</p>

        <li>Data transformation and ETL processes</li>
        <li>Configured detailed dashboard, with KPIs, and visual storytelling elements to explore disparities between communities</li>
        <li>Provided insights into how poverty is directly correlated to test scores</li>

        <h2>Challenges & Lessons</h2>
        <p>One challenge was aligning datasets from different sources with varying schemas and time ranges. I had to ensure data consistency and resolve mismatches in geographic granularity (e.g., county vs. state-level). Another lesson was in using Birstâ€™s semantic layer and visual tools to empower non-technical users to explore complex relationships in the data. This project improved my understanding of data modeling and BI storytelling.</p>
