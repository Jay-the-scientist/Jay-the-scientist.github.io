        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>This project simulates an IoT system designed to help Airbnb hosts monitor their properties remotely using various environmental and occupancy sensors. The system collects data from motion detectors, audio sensors, water leak detectors, door contact sensors, temperature sensors, and air quality monitors. All data is stored in a MongoDB database and visualized through a Flask dashboard. The dashboard alerts users to recent activity and potential issues, such as leaks, loud noises, or poor air quality, making it an effective tool for managing property risks while improving guest safety and experience.</p>

        <h2>Challenges & Lessons</h2>
        <p>The project required careful planning around data modeling for MongoDB to efficiently store and retrieve sensor event streams. I also learned how to design alert logic to flag conditions that matter to a host, such as fire, flooding, gunshot detection, and unapproved entry. This work improved my skills in backend integration, dashboard development, and real-time data monitoring.</p>
