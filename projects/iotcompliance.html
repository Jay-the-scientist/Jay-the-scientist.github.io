      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>This capstone project focused on evaluating the security readiness of consumer IoT devices using a structured testing framework derived from key NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology) publications. The goal was to assess and document how well common IoT products meet recommended cybersecurity practices, with an eye toward improving device trustworthiness in home environments.</p>

    <section class="tech-stack">
      <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
      <li>NIST Special Publications: 800-52, 800-63, 8259, and IR 8267</li>
      <li>Testing methodologies based on standardized compliance frameworks</li>
      <li>Consumer IoT devices including Amazon Smart Plug, Echo Flex, and Google Nest Mini</li>
    </section>

    <section class="tech-stack">
      <h2>What I did</h2>
      <li>Developed a comprehensive testing strategy and plan grounded in NIST best practices</li>
      <li>Assessed IoT devices across six critical areas: Authentication, Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), Cryptography Support, Physical Security, Network Security, and Customer Support</li>
      <li>Conducted alpha testing using real-world devices to evaluate and refine the framework</li>
    </section>

    <section class="challenges">
      <h2>Challenges & Lessons</h2>
      <p>One challenge was translating high-level NIST guidance into specific, actionable tests applicable to consumer-grade devices, which often lack transparency or consistent documentation. Through hands-on testing and collaborative refinement, I gained experience in applying abstract policy frameworks to tangible evaluations, highlighting the gap between compliance recommendations and actual product implementation in the IoT space.</p>
