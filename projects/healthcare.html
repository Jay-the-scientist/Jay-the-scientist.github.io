          <li>Data transformation and ETL processes</li>
          <li>Configured detailed dashboard, with KPIs, and visual storytelling elements to explore disparities between communities</li>
          <li>Provided insights into how poverty is directly correlated to test scores</li>

        <h2>Challenges & Lessons</h2>
        <p>One challenge was aligning datasets from different sources with varying schemas and time ranges. I had to ensure data consistency and resolve mismatches in geographic granularity (e.g., county vs. state-level). Another lesson was in using Birst’s semantic layer and visual tools to empower non-technical users to explore complex relationships in the data. This project improved my understanding of data modeling and BI storytelling.</p>
